 IntelliQueue AI: Context-Aware Reasoning Engine 
A Hybrid ML & Gemini 3 Powered Orchestrator for the "Action Era" of Retail.

 The Vision
In the Action Era, a simple chatbot isn't enough. IntelliQueue AI is an autonomous agent built to solve the unpredictability of physical queues. It moves beyond "static chat" to provide actionable reasoning and real-time planning for store managers.

 Technical Architecture (The Wow Factor)
Unlike standard "Prompt Wrappers," our system uses a dual-engine approach to ensure high-fidelity execution:

Numerical Prediction Engine: Uses a Random Forest Regressor to analyze historical queue data (staff levels, time of day, crowd density).

Contextual Reasoning Engine: Powered by gemini-flash-lite-latest, this engine performs spatiotemporal analysis of environmental factors like "Technical Issues" or "Staff Shortages" to explain the why behind the numbers.

 Strategic Track Alignment: Vibe Engineering
Autonomous Decision Support: Gemini generates "Actionable Artifacts"—not just text, but specific tips to reduce queue friction immediately.

Thinking Levels: The agent analyzes complex scenarios without human supervision, maintaining continuity across different environmental contexts.

 Core Gemini 3 Integration
Multimodal Potential: Built to eventually process real-time video/images for spatial-temporal understanding of crowd behavior.

Reasoning-Over-Data: Natively reasons over predicted wait times to provide high-fidelity business insights.

Testing Instructions for Judges:
1. Access the Live App URL above.

2. Input a crowd level (e.g., 40 people) and select "Technical Issue" as the context.

3. Click "Analyze Queue" to witness how Gemini natively reasons over the complex delay and provides an autonomous mitigation plan.
